  <h1>Hi !</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Shrayzz. A French student in computer science, currently in vacation between my first and second year. </br>
    (you would've guessed that at least I wasn't in art studies considering how this website looks . . .) </br>
    First, Here are all links you may want if you want to know me (note, in most of them I speak in French):

  </ul>

    So, why this project ? After all, there's already a great free and open-source alternative as Ren'Py </br>
    Well, the main objective of this project is far from being as good as Ren'Py in the first place. </br>
    But I still have reasons :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First, I wanted to do a cool project during vacation. Is it possible to do a project like that in just under two months ? </br>
      Considering I only have one year of studying in computer science ? Well, I don't know lol. But I thought that was a cool idea </br>
      so why not ?
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
      Secondly, actually the main reason I wanted to do a cool project during vacation was to maintain my knowledge and not being completely </br>
      lost when coming back at school. Not to be too pretentious, even though I was pretty good I kinda feared I could forget too much if </br>
      I did nothing during vacations.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
      Third, Python is ass. Nah actually it's a good language, I'm just a hater but god-damn I <b>HATE</b> python. Like I still use it </br>
      because it's useful in many cases, but I hate so many things about it. Like it's optimized with ass, so I was pretty sure I could make </br>
      something faster than Ren'Py, considering it would have <em>way</em> less features and written in a better objectively better language. </br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So why c++ in the first place ? Well I like it. I know it may seems weird for some of you that somebody <em>actually</em> likes c++ but </br>
    I'm not lying lmao. It's also because it's very performant and Object-Oriented patterns will help me greatly to realize this project. </br>
    (so that's why no C) </br>
    </br>
    And even though it was first meant as <em>just</em> a project during the vacations, I may actually continue to implement features later </br>
    as I'm 100% sure I won't have the time to do everything I want now. And I may have returns from some of you on what I could, so it probably </br>
    won't end at the end of these vacations. </br>
    </br>
    Oh and I guess y'all have figured out why it's named like this. Couldn't name it something like Visual Novel Engine (first name I thought of) </br>
    but I'm pretty sure this name copyrighted, so I backed off. I just took the three first letter of my username and put VN (for visual novel duh)</br>
    as I thought it looked pretty cool. May change later, but actually I kinda like it, so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna keep it.
