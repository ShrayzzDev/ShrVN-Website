  <h1>Define a character</h1>
  <p>
    To define a character, you have to be in the Character.shrvn file at the root of the project. </br>
    You have to create a character variable like that :
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      Character instance_name("In-Game_name")
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Or like that :
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      Character instance_name("In-Game_name",red_value,green_value,blue_value)
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    instance_name : </br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It's what the program will use to identify the character later in the code. </br>
      Two different characters <b>CAN'T</b> have the same instance name </br>
      For example, in the main script you will show the dialogue of a character like that: </br>
     </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    <code>
      instance_name : "Things to say"
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    In-Game_name : </br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It's the name is going to use when showing the dialogue of a character. </br>
      You <b>can't</b> leave it empty or not put it. It <b> <em>is</em> mandatory</b> </br>
      It's also the name that's going to be used to create the associated character folder in the /images/. </br>
      Even if two different character can't have the same instance name, they can have the same In-Game_name. </br>
      But be weary of the fact that they will use the same folder in the /images/ folder.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    red_value, blue_value and green_value:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      These are the color codes used by the engine when showing the name of a character when talking. </br>
      They can't go above 255 (or FF in hexadecimals). </br>
      You also can't only put just one, you need to else precise none (first way of instantiating a character </br>
      Or precise them all. </br>
      NOTE : If you want to put the code in hex, put 0x in front of the number, or else the engine is going </br>
      to take it as a decimal, as it is what is reads by default. You can do one in hex and the others in decimal, </br>
      and it shouldn't make issues. But it is not recommended as it will make your code more confusing. </br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>
  <p>
    The only difference between the two ways of declaring a character, is that in the first one you don't precise color codes, </br>
    and in the second one you do. By default, (so in the first case), the color codes are all 0, the chracter name will be black. </br>
