  <h1>Add image to character</h1>
  <p>
    In ShrVN, each character have images associated with it. </br>
    It will search images in the <em>project_root</em>/images/<em>In-Game_name</em>/ folder. </br>
    To add an image to a character you use that line:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      From character_instance Add image_path As image_name
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    From :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It's the keyword used to select a character and do something with it. In the character file, you can only add an image. </br>
      Keep in mind that you <b>can't</b> use From statements meant for the main script files here. </br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>
  <p>
    character_instance :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instance name you used when creating the character.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Add :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Key word used to specify what From statement you use.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    image_path :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Path to the image from the /images/<em>In-Game_name</em> folder </br>
      If the file is directly in it, just put the file name. Don't forget to put the image name in the path. </br>
      You also need to put the extension of the file in the path. </br>
      NOTE : Only .jpg, .jpeg and .png files are supported for the moment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keyword used to link to the image_name
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    image_name :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Name used to identify the image later in the script. </br>
      Two images in the same character can't have the same name, but two images from different characters can.
    </li>
  </ul>
