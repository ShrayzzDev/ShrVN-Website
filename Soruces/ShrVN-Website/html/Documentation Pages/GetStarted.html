  <h1>First, let's talk about how the files are structured.</h1>
  <p class="Text">In a ShrVN project, you'll find two directories :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The images directory</li>
    <li>The init directory</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The image directory is pretty self-explanatory, it will contain the images that will be used by the engine. </br>
    Inside it, the project will also make a directory for each character, but we will talk about that deeper later </br>
    The init directory will contain all the files needed to create the layout of the menus, screens, etc . . . </br>
    Don't worry, these have base values and you wil not <em>have to</em> set them yourself. </br>
    If you happen to delete a line by accident, that won't break anything, technically you could delete the init folder </br>
    and the engine would still work, but I wouldn't recommend to do that, even if you don't change the values. </br>
    (this will be detailed in the full documentation, here we'll focus on how to get a basic novel to run) </br>
    </br>
    In the root folder, there's another very import file, the "Characters.shrvn". It will be used to define Characters. </br>
    So, let's talk about how ShrVN handles characters</br>
  </p>
  <h1>Characters</h1>
  <p>
    Here's an example of a character definition :
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      Character jean("Jean")
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    This is the easiest way to create a Character. </br>
    Here, only the name showed in-game is precise, the base color is black #000000 </br>
    The in-game name is Jean, and the instance name is jean. The difference is important. </br>
    The instance name is the one you're going to use when the character is talking in the main script, like that:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      jean : "My name is Jean"
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    You can also use the same name and instance name if you want, that won't cause any problems. </br>
    Also, it is very recommended to use at least 2 letters instance name, for it to be clearer </br>
    If you want to precise the color of the character, you can define the character like that:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      Character jean("Jean",25,25,25)
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    You obviously need to precise the code of each color, if not the game will crash. </br>
    </br>
    Now, let's talk about images. </br>
  </p>
  <h1>Images in Characters</h1>
  <p>
    Each character has its own folder in the images folder. </br>
    For example, here for Jean, when adding images it will look in the Jean folder, in the images folder. </br>
    When instantiating a character, it will automatically create the folder, but you can create it yourself if you want. </br>
    So, you may create all character, launch the game a first time for it to create all folders, and then put the images in it. </br>
    NOTE : The name to the folder is the in-game character name <b>NOT THE INSTANCE NAME</b>. </br>
    Each character has a list of images. You can add an image to a character like that:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      From jean Add smiling.png as Smiling
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    After the 'From', you put the instance name of the character. </br>
    After the Add you put the path to the image, from the images/<i>character_name</i> folder. </br>
    After the As, you put the name that will be used when showing the image in the main script. </br>
  </p>
