	<h1>How coordinates works ?</h1>
	<p>
		They don't have anything really special, but keep in mind that coordinates of something, are the coordinates of it most top-left pixel. </br>
		It isn't very intuitive, so I felt I needed to precise that. </br>
		(it's because I'm using the SDL2 library, and they work like that in it)
